The social golf problem is a combinatorial design problem that can be solved by using breadth first search and backtracking or depth first search and backtracking. The idea is to explore the possible assignments of golfers to groups and weeks in a level-by-level order, and backtrack whenever a conflict occurs. A conflict happens when two golfers play in the same group more than once, or when a group or a week is overfilled.
