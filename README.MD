# Sudoku Solver and Social Golfer Problem Solutions

## Introduction
This project provides solutions to two challenging problems: the Sudoku Solver and the Social Golfer Problem, each solved using two different algorithms:
1. Breadth-First Search (BFS) Backtracking
2. Depth-First Search (DFS) Backtracking

Our implementations showcase the effectiveness of these algorithms in solving complex problems.

## Sudoku Solver
The Sudoku Solver algorithm takes a partially filled grid and finds a valid solution adhering to Sudoku rules.

### Algorithms Used
#### BFS Backtracking
- Implements breadth-first search strategy combined with backtracking.
- [Brief description of how this is implemented or any unique aspects of your approach.]

#### DFS Backtracking
- Uses depth-first search with backtracking.

## Social Golfer Problem
This problem involves arranging golfers into groups across multiple days, ensuring that no two golfers play in the same group more than once.

### Algorithms Used
#### BFS Backtracking
- Utilizes a breadth-first search strategy with backtracking for optimal grouping.
- [Additional details about the approach.]

#### DFS Backtracking
- Applies depth-first search combined with backtracking.
- [Additional details about the approach.]
